### Overview

Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq of single cells (scRNA-seq) as opposed to bulk populations of cells (traditional RNA-seq) is a relatively new technology that is helping to uncover "new" biology.  For example, it has been shown to improve the resolution of cell fate determination, tissue composition, and linked gene regulatory changes.  Applications in cancer research highlight how tumors consist of mixtures of cells which can be resolved based on their gene expression profiles.

Analysis methods for the analysis of single-cell data are still evolving, but generally involve the following approaches:

1.  Dimensionality reduction
2.  Unsupervised clustering
3.  Classification

For this project, I intend to perform some exploratory data analysis on publicly available scRNA-seq data sets from (10X Genomics)[https://www.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/].

In particular, I plan to work on 2 independent but similar data sets profiling peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  These blood cells with a round nucleus play a key role in the immune system's fight against infection and include various types of immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and Natural Killer cells.  As part of the exercise, I hope to build a model for immune-cell type classification using one data set and evaluate whether it is transferable to another independent data set.
